# Testing_Code_python

#documentation: 

This project is divided into three parts. The first part of the project pings different endpoints of the website. It will give information about packet migration, packet loss, how much time it took to execute, and many more. The second part is to verify the validity of the GetRequirements RestHub endpoint. It basically checks the data types of each field. If anything mismatches, it will throw an error. The last part is the updated first task. It will ping all endpoints every minute. It is also called continuous monitoring. 

#installation
